🌄 Adventure Club Project

Adventure Club is a community-driven web platform designed to connect outdoor enthusiasts, explorers, and adventure seekers. The project provides a digital space where users can explore upcoming adventure trips, view destination details, and engage with a growing community of like-minded individuals.

Built as an academic ICT project, Adventure Club demonstrates structured front-end development using HTML and external CSS, with a clear folder organization and responsive design principles. The platform focuses on usability, clean interface design, and accessibility across different screen sizes.

Key features include categorized trip listings, a responsive layout, dark mode support 🌙, and a dedicated contact section for user interaction. The project reflects practical implementation of modern web design concepts while promoting exploration, teamwork, and a connection with nature 🌍.
